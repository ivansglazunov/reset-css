## Motivation to create a project
Initiating the development of styles, with a clean slate. It is not enough to just dump the differences between browsers. I want to paint on a blank canvas document.

No comments in the code, because I do not see them as appropriate. 

Working styles differ from compiled. 
Compiled code is different from the original. 
Source code is expected. 

If there is a problem when applying, please report divergent results.

## Browser support
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari 6+
* Explorer 8+
